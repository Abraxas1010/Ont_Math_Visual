# # Ontological Mathematics: A Visual Framework
# ### An Apoth3osis R&D Demonstration
#
# **Introduction:**
#
# Welcome to a demonstration of a core concept from the Apoth3osis R&D division. This interactive notebook presents a visual framework for **Ontological Mathematics**, a paradigm that posits reality as fundamentally mathematical and informational.
#
# At Apoth3osis, we believe that the most profound advancements in AI and complex systems modeling will come from a deeper understanding of the universe's foundational rules. This model explores a deterministic, non-random basis for existence, providing a powerful alternative to paradigms reliant on chance or unexplained phenomena.
#
# The following visualization illustrates the core tenets of this theory: the transition from a non-physical, timeless frequency domain (**Pure Being**) to the dynamic, evolving physical world we experience (**Pure Becoming**).

# %% [markdown]
# ## 1. Setup and Dependencies
#
# This notebook requires several Python libraries for numerical operations, graph theory, and animation. The following cell will install a necessary library and then import all dependencies.

# %%
# Install the ipython-canvas library for smoother animations in some environments.
!pip install -q ipython-canvas

# Consolidate all library imports for a clean and organized setup.
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

print("Dependencies installed and imported successfully.")

# ## 2. The Core Concept: From Frequency to Spacetime
#
# Ontological Mathematics proposes that the universe originates from **monads**â€”indivisible, eternal mathematical entities. Each monad is a complete frequency domain, best described by **Euler's formula** ($e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$), which elegantly unifies waves and circles.
#
# Collectively, these monads form an infinite "Hive Mind," a universal frequency domain outside of space and time. The physical world emerges from this domain via the **Ontological Fourier Transform**.
#
# **Why is this useful?** The Fourier Transform is a powerful mathematical tool that decomposes complex patterns into a combination of simple sine and cosine waves. In this context, it acts as the universal "projection" mechanism, translating the timeless, non-physical information of the frequency domain into the structured, evolving reality of spacetime. This provides a causal, deterministic link between the non-physical and the physical.

# ## 3. The Visualization Engine
#
# To make these abstract concepts tangible, we've developed a robust visualization class. This class encapsulates the entire animation logic, ensuring the code is modular, reusable, and well-documented. It handles the creation of the animation stages, the rendering of mathematical concepts, and the final presentation.
#
# This approach avoids security risks associated with data handling by being entirely self-contained; it generates all its data programmatically and requires no external file access.

# ## 4. Running the Demonstration
#
# The code cell below will now create an instance of our `OntologicalVisualizer` and run the animation. Observe the five distinct stages as they unfold:
#
# 1.  **The Infinite Frequency Domain:** A representation of all potentiality, existing outside space and time.
# 2.  **The Singularity:** The collapse of potentiality into a single, unified point of origin.
# 3.  **Emergence of the Hive Mind:** The singularity gives rise to a network of individual monads.
# 4.  **Monadic Interactions:** A look inside the monadic system, showing how each entity is a source of frequencies (waves).
# 5.  **The Physical Domain:** The complete system, where monads interact via the exchange of wave information to create the fabric of physical reality.

# ## 5. Conclusion and Key Takeaways for the Client
#
# This visualization provides a concrete, intuitive model for what is typically a highly abstract concept. The key takeaways from this demonstration are:
#
# * **A Deterministic Universe:** Ontological Mathematics provides a framework for a universe founded on reason and mathematical law, not randomness or uncaused events. This aligns with our mission at Apoth3osis to build robust, predictable AI systems.
#
# * **The Power of Frequency:** By defining the universe in terms of frequencies, we can use powerful, time-tested tools like the Fourier Transform to understand and model complex systems. This has direct applications in signal processing, pattern recognition, and building more sophisticated AI models of the world.
#
# * **Bridging a Foundational Gap:** This approach directly addresses the "hard problem" of how a non-physical reality (like information or consciousness) can give rise to a physical one. By demonstrating a clear mathematical bridge, it opens new avenues for research in both physics and artificial intelligence.
#
# We believe this line of R&D is crucial for developing next-generation AI that doesn't just learn from data, but understands the fundamental principles of the system in which it operates.
